# cat-vs-dog
A deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a structured dataset with separate directories for training, validation, and testing, and achieves binary image classification with high accuracy.



The dataset used for training this model was sourced from Kaggle.
